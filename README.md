What Time
===

> Time is a societal construct.
> ~ Jonathan Zong

Time has become ingrained into our society. We look at our phones, laptops, watches with the expectation that they are telling the exact and correct time. We have **blind faith** in these devices in their ability to tell time accurately. But what if they don't?

What Time explores what happens when our devices will never be perfectly "on time." Rather, they will always be off. What will happen? What are the potential applications?
